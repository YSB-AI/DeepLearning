# Classic Approach: Fundamental Deep Learning Architectures

This directory contains a collection of fundamental deep learning projects that demonstrate the core building blocks of computer vision and natural language processing. These "classic" approaches serve as the bedrock for understanding more advanced models.

## Project Collection

### 1. Digit Classification
- **Domain**: Computer Vision
- **Task**: Recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
- **Approach**: Multi-layer perceptrons and basic CNNs to solve fundamental image classification.

### 2. Sentiment Classification & Emojify
- **Domain**: Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- **Task**: Classifying text sentiment and mapping sentences to appropriate emojis.
- **Approach**: Uses word embeddings and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to understand semantic context in short sentences.

### 3. Text Generation
- **Domain**: NLP / Generative Modeling
- **Task**: Predicting the next character or word in a sequence to generate novel text.
- **Approach**: Character-level RNNs trained on literary corpora to learn language patterns and styles.

### 4. Neural Machine Translation
- **Domain**: NLP / Sequence-to-Sequence
- **Task**: Translating text from one language to another.
- **Approach**: Encoder-Decoder architectures with basic sequence-to-sequence modeling.

## Learning Objectives
- Master traditional sequence modeling (RNNs/LSTMs).
- Understand the role of vector embeddings in text processing.
- Build and train foundational CNNs for spatial data.
- Implement end-to-end pipelines from raw data to evaluation.

## Dependencies
Most projects in this folder require:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib pandas
